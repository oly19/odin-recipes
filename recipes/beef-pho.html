    <h2>Beef Pho is a delicious meal. Make sure you have all the ingredients
        before following the recipe.
    </h2>

    <h3>
      List of ingredients:
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Beef bones and tough beef cuts: Beef pho broth usually involves leg 
        and knuckle bones which lend beefy flavor and fat. Tough beef cuts 
        may include oxtail (as Lett101 calls for in this recipe), which 
        contributes its collagen for a rich mouthfeel; beef brisket, chuck, 
        or other kinds of stewy cuts may be substituted, if you prefer 
        boneless meat. Use what fits into your budget and is freshest at the 
        store. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Flat rice noodles: These are similar to the ones used for pad Thai. 
        They may be labeled banh pho at the supermarket or Asian grocer. 
        Dried banh pho last a long time in the cupboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aromatics: Ginger, onion (or shallot) lend sweet-spicy zip and a 
        little pungent note too. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices: The spicing varies from cook to cook. For beef pho, there 
        is typically star anise, cinnamon/cassia sticks, and clove. Here, 
        Lett101 adds peppercorns for a pungent note. Regardless, make sure 
        you use star anise with robust points so your broth gets lots of its 
        savor. Each star anise has 8 points. It is okay to use broken ones. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Daikon: Adding daikon naturally adds earthy sweetness to the broth. 
        Substitute turnip if you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt, sugar, and fish sauce: These are the foundational pho seasonings. 
        For the sugar, Chinese yellow rock sugar is often used for southern 
        Vietnamese-style pho broth; if you don't have it, use granulated sugar 
        (organic has a deeper flavor than white granulated sugar). A sweetener 
        helps to round out pho broth flavor. Fish sauce, sold at many supermarkets 
        and Asian markets, adds umami savoriness to the broth. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Steak: Choose a tender cut of steak. Splurge on marbled meat and slice it 
        thin so it will be cooked quickly by the hot broth. If you do not like 
        raw-ish meat, omit it and focus on the cooked beef!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Step by step recpipe:
    </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Charring onion and ginger slightly turns their harshness into sweetness, 
        which is then extracted in the simmering process
      </li>
      <li>
        After straining and chilling, the fat congeals and is removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then the broth is reheated, bowls are assembled with noodles and thinly 
        sliced steak, and the broth is ladled into the bowls to heat things through 
        and cook off the raw beef. 
    </ol>
