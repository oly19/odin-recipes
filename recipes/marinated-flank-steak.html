    </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, 
        Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade 
        until thoroughly combined. Place steak in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour marinade over flank steak in the baking dish; turn several times to 
        coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, 
        or up to 12 hours if you have time.      
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat 
        and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining 
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to 
        desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
